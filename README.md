# -Music-library-java
In this project, your task will be to create a console application to manage a music library. The application should include the following features:
Add Songs: Allow the user to add songs to the library. The user should be prompted to enter the name of the song, the artist, and the duration of the song in seconds.
View Library: Allow the user to view the current library of songs. The list should be displayed in alphabetical order by artist name.
Search Songs: Allow the user to search for songs by artist name. The user should be prompted to enter the name of the artist, and the application should display a list of all songs by that artist.
Remove Song: Allow the user to remove a song from the library. The user should be prompted to enter the name of the song to remove.
Clear Library: Allow the user to clear the entire library of songs.
A list with 30 random songs have been provided for you in the starter code, in a private static final field called songs in the Application class. You can use these to initialize your library.
You can choose what type of collection you wish to use to manage the songs in the library.
